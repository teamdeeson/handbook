If you are eligible, you can share up to 50 weeks leave, and can decide to be off work at the same time and/or take it in turns to have periods of leave to look after the child. To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:</p><ul><li>You (or your partner) must be entitled to maternity/adoption leave, or statutory maternity/adoption pay (or maternity allowance from the government) and you must share the main responsibility for caring for the child with your partner.</li><li>In addition, you and your partner will also be required to follow a two-step process to establish eligibility as follows:</li></ul><p><strong>Step 1 - Continuity test:</strong> If you are seeking to take shared parental leave, one parent/adopter must have worked for the same employer for at least 26 weeks at the end of the 15th week before the week in which the child is due (or at the week in which an adopter was notified of having been matched with a child or adoption), and they should still be employed in the first week that shared parental leave is to be taken.</p><p>The other parent/adopter has to have worked for 26 weeks in the 66 weeks leading up to the due date and have earned above the maternity allowance threshold of £30 a week in 13 of the 66 weeks.</p><p><strong>Step 2 - Individual eligibility for pay:</strong> To qualify for shared parental pay, the parent/main adopter must, as well as passing the continuity test, also have earned an average salary of the National Insurance lower earnings limit or more, for the eight weeks prior to the 15th week before the expected birth/adoption.</p><p>Although the situation around pregnancy and adoption appears complex, it is normally quite straightforward to work out your entitlement. Therefore, as soon as you know you are pregnant or have been matched with a child for adoption, please let us know as soon as is practical. We will calculate your entitlement and the relevant dates for you.</p><h3>Additional resources</h3><p>We are supporters of The Tommy’s Pregnancy at Work scheme, which is designed to give organisations all the tools they need to provide the best level of support for pregnant employees and their managers.
