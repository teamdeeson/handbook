The fewer projects someone is dealing with, the better they can focus and not lose efficiency through context switching</p><h2>Chapter team.</h2><p>The Chapter is the professional group within the agency – for example development, creative or delivery.</p><p>The Chapter is where professional learning, challenge and R&amp;D happens. It’s also where professional line management takes place, including performance coaching and feedback.</p><p>Each Chapter has a team member who acts as Chapter Lead – an experienced professional whose job it is to bring the Chapter together and help it thrive.</p><h1>Questions and answers about team working.</h1><h2>Who’s in charge of what I do?</h2><p>You are.</p><p>Our project teams are self-organising teams that include all the people with the skills needed to deliver the kind of projects our clients want.</p><p>We don’t have many layers of management hierarchy because we believe that the best way for a team to work, is for team members themselves to devise the best way to hit the team’s goals.</p><h2>Who’s my line manager?</h2><p>You will have a specific line manager who will be a Director, Chapter Lead or Development Manager. Your manager approves holiday requests, as they are accountable for the delivery capacity of their Chapter.</p><p>You are accountable for delivering your professional development through our self-development process (also known as <a  href=\"https://handbook.deeson.co.uk/working-at-deeson/pdp/\">PDP</a>).</p><p>Your line manager, Chapter Lead and the Directors, are responsible for supporting your professional development.</p><p>Directors look after all other line management functions (such as pay, performance improvement, career progression, sickness, welfare and long-term absence, disciplinary, grievance, and appraisals).</p>"}}}
