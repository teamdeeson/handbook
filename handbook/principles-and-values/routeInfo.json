We set up just enough processes and goals for teams – then give them the freedom they need to succeed.</p><p>We deliberately recruit talented and motivated people who are capable of being results driven, not process driven.</p><p>And we’re always thinking about ways that the company can be better centred on our core purpose.</p><p>The more we can concentrate on facilitating the achievement of our goals together and not directing how, then all the better for everyone.</p><p>In summary, at Deeson it’s about ownership of results, not being told what to do and blindly following processes.</p><h2>Core values.</h2><p>Back in 2015, <a  href=\"https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/evolving-our-culture-deeson-facilitation-over-management\">we spoke at length</a> with our team members and clients about what made Deeson different to other agencies and places to work.</p><p>From that insight, we developed a set of core values that inform how we do things, our approach to new business, recruitment and selection, and helping with self-development.</p><p>We use core values as a way to hold ourselves and others to account in our day-to-day actions.</p><p>If we’re not sure how to deal with a particular situation, thinking about the way to proceed with the core values in mind, can be helpful to clarify a way forward.</p><p>Our core values are:</p><ul><li>Be ambitious.</li><li>Be curious.</li><li>Be generous.</li></ul><p>Here are some examples of how Deeson team members bring these values to life in what they do:</p><h3>Be ambitious.</h3><p>Always looking for a better way of doing things.</p><p>Learning new techniques, tools and ways of doing things.</p><p>Embracing big goals and not being afraid to go for them.</p><h3>Be curious.</h3><p>Developers exploring new tools and techniques in Coder Lounge.</p><p>Learning a new coding language to prototype something.</p><p>Producing bespoke giant artworks in your spare time.</p><h3>Be generous.</h3><p>Spending time mentoring inexperienced team members.</p><p>Going above and beyond to help a charity or cause.</p><h2>Putting principles and values into action.</h2><p>We know that sometimes it can be tricky to know how to put principles and values to use during our day-to-day work.</p><p>We ask ourselves six big questions about how we are working, to help make sure the way we&#39;re doing things is consistent with our principles and values:</p><ol><li>Am I confident that the way I’m working is making our clients happy?</li><li>Are the projects I’m working on being delivered successfully?</li><li>Am I effectively collaborating with my team and doing what I need to do to allow my colleagues to get their job done?</li><li>Are we delivering this project profitably and within the budget?</li><li>Am I generating sufficient billable hours?</li><li>Am I happy with the quality of my work?</li></ol><p>Peer-to-peer feedback is important in helping each other answer the above questions.</p><p>If you feel someone is working in a way that makes your life harder, then point this out to them constructively – the onus is on you to give that feedback and them to adapt to make it work.</p>","lastModified":"2018-10-05T22:17:55+0000"}}}
