That means basing our decisions about what we do on some core beliefs:</p><ul><li>We believe that meaning and purpose at work is a good thing.</li><li>We believe that individual accountability is a good thing but we can only succeed or fail as a team.</li><li>We believe our team members know how to do their own job best. We set up just enough processes and goals for teams – then give them the freedom they need to succeed.</li><li>We believe success comes from deliberately recruiting talented and motivated people who are capable of being results driven, not process driven.</li></ul><p>In summary, at Deeson it’s about ownership of results, not being told what to do and blindly following processes.</p><h2>Core values.</h2><p>Back in 2015, <a  href=\"https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/evolving-our-culture-deeson-facilitation-over-management\">we spoke at length</a> with our team members and clients about what made Deeson different to other agencies and places to work. From that insight, we developed a set of core values that inform how we do things, our approach to new business, recruitment and selection, and helping with self-development.</p><p>We use core values as a way to hold ourselves and others to account in our day-to-day actions. If we’re not sure how to deal with a particular situation, thinking about the way to proceed with the core values in mind, can be helpful to clarify a way forward.</p><p>Our core values are:</p><ul><li>Be ambitious.</li><li>Be curious.</li><li>Be generous.</li></ul><p>Here are some examples of how Deeson team members bring these values to life in what they do:</p><h3>Be ambitious.</h3><ul><li>Always looking for a better way of doing things.</li><li>Learning new techniques, tools and ways of doing things.</li><li>Embracing big goals and not being afraid to go for them.</li></ul><h3>Be curious.</h3><ul><li>Developers exploring new tools and techniques in Coder Lounge.</li><li>Learning a new coding language to prototype something.</li><li>Producing bespoke giant artworks in your spare time.</li></ul><h3>Be generous.</h3><ul><li>Spending time mentoring inexperienced team members.</li><li>Going above and beyond to help a charity or cause.</li></ul>","lastModified":"2020-02-05T13:35:23+0000","slices":[]}}}
