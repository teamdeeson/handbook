Job roles are defined in terms of &#39;impacts&#39; in a job scorecard – things that a team member does which make a difference to the business.</p><p>In some cases, individuals will perform more than one of the roles on a project. As an individual&#39;s career progresses, they are likely to take on more roles. This allows individuals to grow and develop professionally by moving into new areas and working on new skills.</p><h2>Shared accountabilities.</h2><p>Here are the specific accountabilities we all share, regardless of our job title and role on any specific project:</p><ul><li>Client satisfaction.</li><li>Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec).</li><li>Your own capacity.</li><li>Your own capability.</li><li>Supporting your colleagues.</li><li>Following company processes.</li></ul><h2>Roles and scorecards.</h2><p>At Deeson, each job role has a job scorecard. This sets out what impact we expect a team member to have in a particular role and is used in 1:1s, impact scoring and professional development planning.</p><p>The roles and job scorecards are shown below:</p><h3>Technical Chapter.</h3><ul><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F34d2ca9d-8273-49af-85c7-1e2585242c2c_job+scorecard+-+developer.pdf\">Developer</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F2cf7f282-463a-4c3e-85e9-451f1ef605dc_job+scorecard+-+senior+developer.pdf\">Senior Developer</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fa567627c-b185-4d64-94b6-ba60fa0c8a1c_job+scorecard+-+lead+developer.pdf\">Lead Developer</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fbfaf994f-5312-480a-9afd-8d3d8f68ebe0_job+scorecard+-+development+manager.pdf\">Development Manager</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F840653f0-846c-4c94-981d-f1b1001bac5f_job+scorecard+-+technical+project+director.pdf\">Technical Director</a></li></ul><h3>Design Chapter.</h3><ul><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F3f726f21-7145-4fa7-a2c4-3d5fea3c08a2_job+scorecard+-+user+experience+analyst.pdf\">UX Designer</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F1ed08442-2288-40f9-b058-37473ba21cf2_job+scorecard+-+user+researcher.pdf\">User Researcher</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fa5ecb6af-a95d-47b7-88d8-92d9491aeb98_job+scorecard+-+designer.pdf\">Designer</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fc60aade4-9042-4f5a-b1db-b51acf4ce08b_job+scorecard+-+creative+lead.pdf\">Creative Lead</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F60723967-4630-4f07-bc97-59812ac59c67_job+scorecard+-+head+of+product+and+experience+design.pdf\">Head of Product and Experience Design</a></li></ul><h3>Delivery Chapter.</h3><ul><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F6bf973da-7bdc-4360-bb96-1318042528ac_job+scorecard+-+delivery+manager.pdf\">Delivery Manager</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fc193aa05-06fc-4af9-b3a6-94f518af6791_job+scorecard+-+head+of+delivery.pdf\">Head of Delivery</a></li></ul><h3>Account Management.</h3><ul><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Ff3d8fb93-5d80-4cf0-865a-cf9205b76f04_job+scorecard+-+account+manager.pdf\">Account Manager</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F4988fe5e-fa00-40d6-bc4f-a36b03c8f778_job+scorecard+-+account+director.pdf\">Head of Client Services</a></li></ul><h3>Other roles.</h3><ul><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2Fa94e2ab7-672f-48b6-8fc5-7980727eca5a_job+scorecard+-+finance+and+operations+manager.pdf\">Finance and Operations Manager</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F024dc81a-8c97-4aa8-8086-b8f0f52bbf90_job+scorecard+-+finance+%26+operations+assistant.pdf\">Finance and Operations Assistant</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F3fb60b6b-d695-469c-963c-24be2aecf195_job+scorecard+-+finance+director+%28fd%29.pdf\">Finance Director</a></li><li><a  href=\"https://deeson-handbook.cdn.prismic.io/deeson-handbook%2F4b761e44-0ee6-42a0-9973-d0744bc7e58e_job+scorecard+-+managing+director+%28md%29.pdf\">Managing Director</a></li></ul><h2>Additional roles.</h2><p>These roles support the improvement of the Chapters and agency as a whole, and give individuals new routes for professional development.</p><h3>Chapter Lead.</h3><p>At Deeson, everyone is a member of a Chapter that supports their specialism.
