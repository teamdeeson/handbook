Job roles are defined in terms of &#39;impacts&#39; in a job scorecard – things that a team member does which make a difference to the business.</p><p>In some cases, individuals will perform more than one of the roles on a project. As an individual&#39;s career progresses, they are likely to take on more roles. This allows individuals to grow and develop professionally by moving into new areas and working on new skills.</p><h2>Shared accountabilities.</h2><p>Here are the specific accountabilities we all share, regardless of our job title and role on any specific project:</p><ul><li>Client satisfaction.</li><li>Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec).</li><li>Your own capacity.</li><li>Your own capability.</li><li>Supporting your colleagues.</li><li>Following company processes.</li></ul><h2>Roles and scorecards.</h2><p>At Deeson, each job role has a job scorecard.
