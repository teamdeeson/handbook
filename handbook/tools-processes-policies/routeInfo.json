Every project board also includes key delivery metrics which help us assess the health of the project (internal only).</li><li>Our time recording tool – <a  href=\"https://deesonemedia.harvestapp.com/overview\">Harvest</a>.</li><li>Our forecasting and resource planning tool – <a  href=\"https://forecastapp.com/89482/schedule/team\">Forecast</a>.</li><li>Our project management tool – <a  href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">JIRA</a>.</li><li>Our instant communication tool – <a  href=\"https://deeson-agency.slack.com/\">Slack</a>.</li><li>Google Drive – Project documentation repository and shared files with clients.</li><li>Our Invoicing tool – <a  href=\"https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/\">Xero</a>.</li><li>Our HR tool for annual leave/sickness requests – <a  href=\"https://deeson.bamboohr.co.uk/\">Bamboo HR</a>.</li></ul><p>If a company-wide standard tool or process isn’t working as well as you think it could or you think there’s a better way, get a group together and recommend a better way for consideration.</p><h2>Clients on Slack.</h2><p>We&#39;ve found Slack to be an excellent internal communication tool and we also use it with clients as an additional communication method while we&#39;re working on their projects.</p><p>There are a few things we make clear to our clients:</p><ul><li>It’s a great way for both of us to get quick answers to each other&#39;s questions; we&#39;ll be able to post updates and when applicable hold short, effective conversations.</li><li>We&#39;ve achieved a great balance of being responsive whilst still allowing our team to focus on their work. Slack doesn’t promise any faster response times than we&#39;re already able to deliver via other communication means.</li><li>Likewise, we&#39;re not asking clients to be any more available to us than they already are.</li></ul><p>And there are a few things we expect our employees to be aware of:</p><ul><li>Client Slack channels use the naming protocol &#39;ext-[clientname]&#39; or &#39;ext-[clientname]-[personname]&#39;.</li><li>Client Slack channels are always private channels.</li><li>We only invite the necessary client-facing team members to the channel.</li><li>We always brief the client on how we use Slack for client service when we set them up.</li></ul><h2>Company-wide processes and policies.</h2><ul><li><a  href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17aO5PCU5aKBxPIXeRnuvK76trgVbn10qjIuuZzB9zhA/edit\">The Deeson agile delivery methodology</a>.</li><li><a  href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/131K6oPB94dtb9WA-SYAfjVAdRqrK4b4DdMGctHqUivI/edit\">Estimating methodology</a> (currently internal only).</li><li><a  href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_nUPb3wfpJewQyOxWj-IHdTiR9NRXbB576Hk0-G5zJw/edit#\">JIRA ticket configuration</a>.</li><li><a  href=\"https://www.deeson.co.uk/labs/well-defined-stories-key-eliminating-work-flow-delays\">JIRA workflow</a>.</li><li>Recruitment.</li><li><a  href=\"https://handbook.deeson.co.uk/working-at-deeson/pdp/\">Personal Development Planning</a>.</li><li>Company business policies.</li></ul>","lastModified":"2018-10-05T22:19:39+0000","slices":[]}}}
