This would mean our staffing cost to income ratio would be less than 57.1%.</p><p>In such situations we feel it’s fair that team members overall receive the benefit of this improved business performance.</p><p>For example, regarding our target ratio of 57.1% for 2017/18 – if at the end of the company’s financial year, the total staffing costs only equate to 53% of our agency revenue, the remaining 4.1% will be distributed equally to all eligible staff as a bonus, once the agency’s end of year accounts have been finalised.</p><p>The &#39;fair pay&#39; guarantee works like this:</p><ul><li>The total &#39;fair pay&#39; guarantee payment is calculated based on the end of year accounts that are prepared from October to December each year.
