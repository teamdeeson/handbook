It&#39;s called the taco scheme because team members give each other recognition on Slack by using the taco emoji!</p><p>Each week, the five people who have received the most tacos are in with a chance of winning Amazon vouchers, or cash for themselves or their chosen charity.</p><p>The company puts £100 per week into the prize pot and the prize is paid out based on a dice roll each week. A score of one or six means the pot pays out, otherwise the prize fund rolls over to the next week and grows.</p><h2>How it works.</h2><ul><li>Every day you can give away up to five tacos to other team members to recognise them for doing something great.</li><li>You can give someone a taco by using the :taco: emoji on Slack – for example, &#39;@joebloggs great work today on bug fixing :taco:&#39;.</li><li>More info on how to give tacos and other functionality: https://www.heytaco.chat/about.</li><li>At the end of each week, we share the leaderboard of who’s been awarded the most tacos by their colleagues.
