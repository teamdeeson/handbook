If we don’t do this, we’ve found that we end up paying for unused subscriptions or for the wrong number of users. This costs the company more than it needs to and that’s a bad thing.</p><p>That’s why we say that all subscriptions must be paid for on a Chapter Lead or Director’s company credit card.</p><p>If you wish to take out a subscription or feel the company could benefit from a particular service, speak with the appropriate card holder and they can arrange for the payment to be set up.</p><p><em>This information is for team members employed by Deeson Group Ltd and Deeson Publishing Ltd.</em></p>","lastModified":"2018-10-05T22:52:32+0000"}}}
