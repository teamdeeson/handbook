transition to being a member of the Deeson team.</p><p>We want new team members to be happy, engaged and effective as soon as possible.</p><p>This section of our handbook explains what we do to support new team members, from the day they sign their Deeson contract, through to the end of their first year with the company.</p><p>Like all our processes, onboarding is something we review regularly to make sure it’s doing the job that we need it to.</p><h2>Accountability.</h2><p>As a new team member, you are accountable for your own onboarding.</p><p>You’ll find that everyone in the agency will be able to help you out and point you in the right direction.

We&#39;ll also make sure you have access fobs and keys for the Deeson offices.</p><h2>On your first day.</h2><p>We know that there’s a lot to take in on your first day in a new job. We’ll introduce you to lots of people but we don’t expect you to remember everyone’s name!</p><p>The outcomes for your first day at Deeson are shown below:</p><ol><li>You’ll have been shown around your main office.</li><li>You’ll know where your desk is and where you can hotdesk in the office.</li><li>You’ll have your laptop up and running, with the core business systems set up and working properly (Google Apps, Slack, Harvest, Forecast etc.</li><li>You’ll have had a coffee or lunch with some colleagues.</li><li>You’ll have completed the new joiner paperwork and provided the proof of a right to work in the UK.</li><li>You’ll have been introduced to the Deeson Handbook and will have begun reading it.</li></ol><h2>In your first week.</h2><p>Having made it through your first day, your first week is about getting to know the way we do things, meeting more people and getting started in your role.</p><p>The outcomes for your first week at Deeson are shown below:</p><ol><li>You’ll have consulted with a Chapter colleague to make sure you have everything installed on your machine to do your job.
