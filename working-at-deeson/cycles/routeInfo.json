The deduction is made from your gross salary, so you make income tax and national insurance savings.</p><p>If you want to purchase a bike or e-bike using this benefit, please check out the details below and then speak to Hannah to get the paperwork sorted out. You need to do this before committing to purchase the bike from a retailer.</p><p>At Deeson we provide this benefit using two partners:</p><h2>Cyclescheme.</h2><p>Cyclescheme works with more than 2,000 local and online retailers.
