Team members employed by Deeson Publishing Ltd are welcome to join in if they wish to.</em></p><p>Because we have flexible working, we have some things that we do to help keep everyone in touch with what&#39;s happening in the agency and help us grow as a team.</p><p>This page explains more about these things and what they mean for each team member.</p><h2>The weekly company news</h2><p>This is a written rundown of the highlights of this week and a look forward to next week. Normally written by the MD, but sometimes guest written by another team member.</p><p>Published by 10am every Friday morning on the #things-to-know Slack channel.</p><h2>The weekly all-company ask me anything (“AMA”) session</h2><p>This is a video call at 3pm every Friday which is an informal opportunity to chat through the weekly news, ask questions and generally catch-up on the weeks we&#39;ve had and what&#39;s coming up.</p><p>Nothing&#39;s off limits for conversation, discussion and debate.</p><p>The link to the Zoom call is on the calendar invitation.</p><h2>The weekly office day</h2><p>This is a day each week where all team members are physically present in the office.</p><p>In the Canterbury office we do it on Mondays, while in the London office it&#39;s on Wednesdays. The days were decided by a company vote.</p><p>The default should be that everyone commits to be there on that day each week, but client or flexible working needs are an ok reason to not be there.</p><p>We&#39;d like everyone to be in the office that day, but we don&#39;t want to take away the flexibility that we all have if it has to be used that day.</p><p>For example if you have an appointment that means you absolutely can&#39;t be in the office on the weekly office day, it&#39;s fine to be flexible and work from home - but if you have the choice of arranging that appointment for another day, then we’d prefer you chose the other day.</p><h2>Monthly compulsory all-agency day in Canterbury</h2><p>This is a day when the whole digital agency (Canterbury and London team members) are physically working together in the Canterbury office.</p><p>We finish work at 4pm for a one hour company get-together - this will feature things like show&#39;n&#39;tell sessions from recent launches, lightning talks on interesting topics, a celebration of achievements for the month and other interesting stuff.</p><p>The session will include drinks and snacks.</p><p>These days are scheduled at least four weeks in advance so everyone can plan in advance.</p><h2>Quarterly compulsory all-agency hack day</h2><p>This is a day when the whole digital agency (Canterbury and London team members) are in the Canterbury office and are not working on client projects.</p><p>This is blocked in Forecast for everyone and is an agreed reduction to everyone&#39;s billable targets for that week.</p><p>If you&#39;re working, we expect you to be there. If you&#39;re on holiday, you don&#39;t have to be there.</p><p>We work together in groups on solving interesting challenges - there’s some preparation needed in advance to make sure we get the most of our these sessions.</p><p>These days are scheduled at least eight weeks in advance so everyone can plan in advance.</p><p>Publishing team members are optional unless specifically involved with hack days (eg where content skills might be vital for an activity that’s planned for the hack day).</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><p>We&#39;ll do the all-agency day in Canterbury on the months when we&#39;re not doing the hack day - so there in total there is always one all-company co-located day in Canterbury per month.</p>","lastModified":"2018-10-05T22:48:03+0000","slices":[]}}}
